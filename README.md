ARCHERY game is single player game where the player hits the target. The target is a block with hole in center & the player should hit the target. There are 15 arrows, 10 blocks.

The arrow is made of three parts tip, shaft and nock. The block is covered by an elastic material which breaks when the tip of the arrow hits it exactly at the center. We have arrow count shown on the screen.
The player should aim the first arrow with lot of concentration as the speed is max initially and decreases as each arrow vanishes. We have used right button of the mouse to help the user know about the instructions.

The target can be hit by arrow by pressing ‘r’ key on the keyboard. If the user wishes to quit or exit from the game he can use the key ‘q’ on the keyboard. 


Once the player begins the game the arrow starts moving to hit the target by following the given instruction. As the arrow is heading to the target and finally reaches the end of the screen the arrow count increases indication the no of arrows already used. Once the arrow count becomes 15 the game ends. If the player has hit all the targets then he wins the game, otherwise loses it.
